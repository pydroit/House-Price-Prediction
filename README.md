## Real Estate Price Prediction Using Machine Learning

Conventional means of predicting the price of real estate is often error prone, inaccurate and long-drawn-out because it requires manual application of human experience, understanding of the market forces, and making of subjective analysis.

What if there is an accurate and non-subjective way to predict the price of houses? Advancement in technology through the use of Machine Learning (ML), the availability of large volume real estate data, and the massive computing power available today to process this data has now made it possible to more accurately predict house prices.

This work aims at developing Machine Learning models that predict the price of houses and answer the following questions:

1.	What regression models perform best in the prediction of real estate price?
2.	What impact will ensemble and hyperparameter tuning have?
3.	What features have the most impact on prediction accuracy?

Stakeholders will find models like this useful in helping their clients make the best informed decisions and knowing where to invest in a way that suits their business needs.
